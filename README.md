# Private Functions Analysis
This repository contains a MongoDB project focused on analyzing private functions and their characteristics. The dataset provides information about various private functions, including details such as function type, food choices, number of guests, duration, disc jockey details, and venue information.

The project aims to provide insights into private functions, enabling event planners and managers to enhance the quality of their services and meet customers' needs more effectively.

10.Using Advanced Aggregate Function in MongoDB
   - Aggregate Query 1: Find the maximum number of guests for each year
   - Aggregate Query 2: Find the total number of guests and the average duration of each function type held in the city of Mountrath
   - Aggregate Query 3: Find the average fee for each disc jockey who performed at Athlone and have a fee less than 500 euros, sorted in ascending order
   - Aggregate Query 4: Find the number of functions held in each venue type, sorted in descending order
   - Aggregate Query 5: Find the total count of events held in each city where the venue was Park, and only include cities where more than 1 event has been held
   - Aggregate Query 6: Find the average fee for a disc jockey, grouped by the day of the week they are available on
   - Aggregate Query 7: Find venues with good acoustics and a capacity greater than or equal to 400, sorted in ascending order of capacity
   - Aggregate Query 8: What are the top three most popular types of events held each year, based on the average number of guests and duration, as well as the unique food and alcohol choices served at each event?
   - Aggregate Query 9: What is the breakdown of event statistics for each city in the database, including the total number of events, the average and maximum number of guests, average fee for disc jockeys, and top three food choices for events in each city?
   - Aggregate Query 10: What are the top 10 food choices for weddings with at least 300 guests, and how many times was each food choice served, and what is the average number of guests for each choice?
